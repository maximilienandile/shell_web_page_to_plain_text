   Alan Mathison Turing [38]OBE [39]FRS ([40]/|tjU@rIN/; 23 June 1912 - 7
   June 1954) was an English [41]computer scientist, [42]mathematician,
   [43]logician, [44]cryptanalyst and [45]theoretical biologist. He was
   highly influential in the development of [46]theoretical computer
   science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of [47]algorithm and
   [48]computation with the [49]Turing machine, which can be considered a
   model of a general purpose computer.^[50][2]^[51][3]^[52][4] Turing is
   widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and
   [53]artificial intelligence.^[54][5]

   During the [55]Second World War, Turing worked for the [56]Government
   Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at [57]Bletchley Park, Britain's
   [58]codebreaking centre. For a time he led [59]Hut 8, the section
   responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of
   techniques for speeding the breaking of German [60]ciphers, including
   improvements to the pre-war Polish [61]bombe method, an
   [62]electromechanical machine that could find settings for the
   [63]Enigma machine. Turing played a pivotal role in cracking
   intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis
   in many crucial engagements, including the [64]Battle of the Atlantic;
   it has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by
   more than two years and saved over fourteen million lives.^[65][6]

   After the war, he worked at the [66]National Physical Laboratory, where
   he designed the [67]ACE, among the first designs for a stored-program
   computer. In 1948 Turing joined [68]Max Newman's [69]Computing Machine
   Laboratory at the [70]Victoria University of Manchester, where he
   helped develop the [71]Manchester computers^[72][7] and became
   interested in [73]mathematical biology. He wrote a paper on the
   chemical basis of [74]morphogenesis, and predicted [75]oscillating
   [76]chemical reactions such as the [77]Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction,
   first observed in the 1960s.

   Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for homosexual acts, when it was still
   [78]a criminal act in the UK. He accepted treatment with [79]DES
   ([80]chemical castration) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in
   1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from [81]cyanide poisoning. An
   inquest determined his death as [82]suicide, but it has been noted that
   the known evidence is equally consistent with accidental
   poisoning.^[83][8] In 2009, following an [84]Internet campaign,
   [85]British Prime Minister [86]Gordon Brown made an [87]official public
   apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he
   was treated." [88]Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon in
   2013.^[89][9]^[90][10]^[91][11]

Early life[[127]edit]

   Turing was born in [128]Maida Vale, [129]London, while his father,
   Julius Mathison Turing (1873-1947), was on leave from his position with
   the [130]Indian Civil Service (ICS) at [131]Chhatrapur, [132]Bihar and
   Orissa Province, in [133]British India.^[134][12]^[135][13] Turing's
   father was the son of a clergyman, the Rev. John Robert Turing, from a
   Scottish family of merchants that had been based in the
   [136]Netherlands and included a [137]baronet. Turing's mother, Julius'
   wife, was Ethel Sara (née Stoney; 1881-1976), daughter of Edward Waller
   Stoney, chief engineer of the [138]Madras Railways. The Stoneys were a
   [139]Protestant [140]Anglo-Irish [141]gentry family from both
   [142]County Tipperary and [143]County Longford, while Ethel herself had
   spent much of her childhood in [144]County Clare.^[145][14]

   Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where
   his grandfather had been a general in the [146]Bengal Army. However,
   both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in
   Britain, so they moved to [147]Maida Vale,^[148][15] London, where Alan
   Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a [149]blue plaque on
   the outside of the house of his birth,^[150][16]^[151][17] later the
   [152]Colonnade Hotel.^[153][12]^[154][18] He had an elder brother, John
   (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the [155]Turing
   baronets).

   Turing's father's civil service commission was still active and during
   Turing's childhood years Turing's parents travelled between
   [156]Hastings in England^[157][19] and India, leaving their two sons to
   stay with a retired [158]Army couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at
   Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, [159]St Leonards-on-Sea, now marked with
   a blue plaque.

   Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later
   to display prominently.^[160][20] His parents purchased a house in
   [161]Guildford in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays.
   The location is also marked with a blue plaque.^[162][21]

Education[[163]edit]

School[[164]edit]

   Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20
   Charles Road, [165]St Leonards-on-Sea, at the age of six. The
   headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his
   subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to
   [166]Sherborne School, an independent school in the [167]market town of
   [168]Sherborne in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the
   [169]1926 General Strike in Britain, but he was so determined to attend
   that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied 60 miles (97 km) from
   [170]Southampton to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.^[171][22]

   Turing's natural inclination towards mathematics and science did not
   earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose
   definition of education placed more emphasis on the [172]classics. His
   headmaster wrote to his parents: "I hope he will not fall between two
   stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming
   educated. If he is to be solely a Scientific Specialist, he is wasting
   his time at a public school".^[173][23] Despite this, Turing continued
   to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced
   problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary [174]calculus.
   In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [175]Albert Einstein's work; not
   only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce
   Einstein's questioning of [176]Newton's laws of motion from a text in
   which this was never made explicit.^[177][24]

Christopher Morcom[[178]edit]

   At Sherborne, Turing formed a significant friendship with fellow pupil
   Christopher Morcom, who has been described as Turing's "first love".
   Their relationship provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours,
   but it was cut short by Morcom's death, in February 1930, from
   complications of [179]bovine tuberculosis, contracted after drinking
   infected cow's milk some years
   previously.^[180][25]^[181][26]^[182][27]

   The event caused Turing great sorrow. He coped with his grief by
   working that much harder on the topics of science and mathematics that
   he had shared with Morcom. In a letter to Morcom's mother Turing said:

     I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so
     brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited. I regarded my
     interest in my work, and in such things as astronomy (to which he
     introduced me) as something to be shared with him and I think he
     felt a little the same about me ... I know I must put as much energy
     if not as much interest into my work as if he were alive, because
     that is what he would like me to do.^[183][28]

   Some have speculated that Morcom's death was the cause of Turing's
   [184]atheism and [185]materialism.^[186][29] Apparently, at this point
   in his life he still believed in such concepts as a spirit, independent
   of the body and surviving death. In a later letter, also written to
   Morcom's mother, Turing said:

     Personally, I believe that spirit is really eternally connected with
     matter but certainly not by the same kind of body ... as regards the
     actual connection between spirit and body I consider that the body
     [can] hold on to a 'spirit', whilst the body is alive and awake the
     two are firmly connected. When the body is asleep I cannot guess
     what happens but when the body dies, the 'mechanism' of the body,
     holding the spirit is gone and the spirit finds a new body sooner or
     later, perhaps immediately.^[187][30]

University and work on computability[[188]edit]

   After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934
   at [189]King's College, Cambridge, whence he gained first-class honours
   in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a [190]fellow
   of King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the
   [191]central limit theorem,^[192][31] despite the fact that the
   committee had failed to identify that it had already been proven in
   1922 by [193]Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg.^[194][32]

   In 1936, Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an
   Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" (1936).^[195][33] In this
   paper, Turing reformulated [196]Kurt Gödel's 1931 results on the limits
   of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based
   formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that
   became known as [197]Turing machines. [198]Entscheidungsproblem
   (decision problem) was originally posed by German mathematician
   [199]David Hilbert in 1928. Turing proved that his "universal computing
   machine" would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical
   computation if it were representable as an [200]algorithm. He went on
   to prove that there was no solution to the decision problem by first
   showing that the [201]halting problem for Turing machines is
   [202]undecidable: It is not possible to decide algorithmically whether
   a Turing machine will ever halt.
   [203]King's College, Cambridge, where Turing was a student in 1931 and
   became a Fellow in 1935. The computer room is named after him.

   Although Turing's proof was published shortly after [204]Alonzo
   Church's equivalent proof^[205][34] using his [206]lambda calculus,
   Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than
   Church's.^[207][35] It also included a notion of a 'Universal Machine'
   (now known as a [208]universal Turing machine), with the idea that such
   a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine (as
   indeed could Church's lambda calculus). According to the
   [209]Church-Turing thesis, Turing machines and the lambda calculus are
   capable of computing anything that is computable. [210]John von Neumann
   acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to
   Turing's paper.^[211][36] To this day, Turing machines are a central
   object of study in [212]theory of computation.

   From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time
   studying under Church at [213]Princeton University. In addition to his
   purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of
   four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.^[214][37] In
   June 1938, he obtained his PhD from Princeton;^[215][38] his
   dissertation, [216]Systems of Logic Based on
   Ordinals,^[217][39]^[218][40] introduced the concept of [219]ordinal
   logic and the notion of [220]relative computing, where Turing machines
   are augmented with so-called [221]oracles, allowing the study of
   problems that cannot be solved by Turing machines.

   When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939
   by [222]Ludwig Wittgenstein about the [223]foundations of
   mathematics.^[224][41] Remarkably, the lectures have been reconstructed
   verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from
   students' notes.^[225][42] Turing and Wittgenstein argued and
   disagreed, with Turing defending [226]formalism and Wittgenstein
   propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute
   truths, but rather invents them.^[227][43]

Cryptanalysis[[228]edit]

   During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the
   breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime
   codebreaker [229]Asa Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent,
   you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius."^[230][44]
   From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the
   [231]GC&CS, the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on
   [232]cryptanalysis of the Enigma with [233]Dilly Knox, a senior GC&CS
   codebreaker.^[234][45] Soon after the July 1939 [235]Warsaw meeting at
   which the [236]Polish Cipher Bureau had provided the British and French
   with the details of the wiring of [237]Enigma rotors and their method
   of decrypting [238]Enigma code messages, Turing and Knox started to
   work on a less fragile approach to the problem.^[239][46] The Polish
   method relied on an insecure [240]indicator procedure that the Germans
   were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach
   was more general, using [241]crib-based decryption for which he
   produced the functional specification of the [242]bombe (an improvement
   of the Polish [243]Bomba).^[244][47]
   Two cottages in the stable yard at [245]Bletchley Park. Turing worked
   here in 1939 and 1940, before moving to [246]Hut 8.

   On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany,
   Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of
   GC&CS.^[247][48] Specifying the bombe was the first of five major
   cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others
   were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy;
   developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use
   of the bombes dubbed [248]Banburismus; developing a procedure for
   working out the cam settings of the wheels of the [249]Lorenz SZ 40/42
   (Tunny) dubbed [250]Turingery and, towards the end of the war, the
   development of a portable [251]secure voice scrambler at [252]Hanslope
   Park that was codenamed Delilah.

   By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different
   possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative
   contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing
   mathematical approaches, titled The Applications of Probability to
   Cryptography^[253][49] and Paper on Statistics of
   Repetitions,^[254][50] which were of such value to GC&CS and its
   successor [255]GCHQ that they were not released to the [256]UK National
   Archives until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A
   GCHQ mathematician said at the time that the fact that the contents had
   been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their
   importance.^[257][51]

   Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley
   Park. He was known to his colleagues as 'Prof' and his treatise on
   Enigma was known as 'The Prof's Book'.^[258][52] [259]Jack Good, a
   cryptanalyst who worked with him, is quoted by [260]Ronald Lewin as
   having said of Turing:

     In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay
     fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask
     to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would
     come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would
     count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off
     the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his
     eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to
     prevent it being stolen.^[261][53]

   While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance
   runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to London when he was
   needed for high-level meetings,^[262][54] and he was capable of
   world-class marathon standards.^[263][55]^[264][56] Turing tried out
   for the 1948 British Olympic team, hampered by an injury. His tryout
   time for the marathon was only 11 minutes slower than British silver
   medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2 hours 35 minutes. He
   was Walton Athletic Club's best runner, a fact discovered when he
   passed the group while running alone.^[265][57]^[266][58]^[267][59]

   In 1945, Turing was awarded the [268]OBE by King [269]George VI for his
   wartime services, but his work remained secret for many
   years.^[270][60]

Bombe[[271]edit]

   Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,^[272][48] Turing had
   specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma
   more effectively than the Polish [273]bomba kryptologiczna, from which
   its name was derived. The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by
   mathematician [274]Gordon Welchman, became one of the primary tools,
   and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.

   Jack Good opined:

     Turing's most important contribution, I think, was of part of the
     design of the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine. He had the idea that
     you could use, in effect, a theorem in logic which sounds, to the
     untrained ear, rather absurd; namely that, from a contradiction, you
     can deduce everything.^[275][61]

   A complete and working replica of a [276]bombe at the National Codes
   Centre at Bletchley Park

   The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma
   message (i.e., rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings),
   using a suitable [277]crib: a fragment of probable [278]plaintext. For
   each possible setting of the rotors (which had on the order of 10^19
   states, or 10^22 states for the four-rotor U-boat variant),^[279][62]
   the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib,
   implemented electrically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had
   occurred and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the
   possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving
   only a few to be investigated in detail. A contradiction would occur
   when an enciphered letter would be turned back into the same plaintext
   letter - this simply wasn't possible with the Enigma. The first bombe
   was installed on 18 March 1940.^[280][63]

   By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman,
   [281]Hugh Alexander, and [282]Stuart Milner-Barry were frustrated.
   Building on the [283]work of the Poles, they had set up a good working
   system for decrypting Enigma signals, but they only had a few people
   and a few bombes, so they did not have time to translate all the
   signals. In the summer, they had had considerable success, and shipping
   losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month, but they were still on
   a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of
   German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more
   bombes through the proper channels, but they were getting nowhere.
   Finally, breaking all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to
   [284]Winston Churchill spelling out their difficulties, with Turing as
   the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with
   the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with
   the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.^[285][64]

   As [286]Andrew Hodges, biographer of Turing, later wrote, "This letter
   had an electric effect."^[287][65] Churchill wrote a memo to
   [288]General Ismay, which read: "ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have
   all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been
   done." On 18 November, the chief of the secret service reported that
   every possible measure was being taken.^[289][65] The cryptographers at
   Bletchley Park did not know of the Prime Minister's response, but as
   Milner-Barry later recalled, "All that we did notice was that almost
   from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made
   smooth."^[290][66] More than two hundred bombes were in operation by
   the end of the war.^[291][67]

Hut 8 and the naval Enigma[[292]edit]

   Turing by [293]Stephen Kettle at Bletchley Park, commissioned by
   [294]Sidney Frank, built from half a million pieces of Welsh
   slate.^[295][68]

   Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of
   [296]German naval Enigma "because no one else was doing anything about
   it and I could have it to myself".^[297][69] In December 1939, Turing
   solved the essential part of the naval [298]indicator system, which was
   more complex than the indicator systems used by the other
   services.^[299][69]^[300][70] That same night, he also conceived of the
   idea of [301]Banburismus, a sequential statistical technique (what
   [302]Abraham Wald later called [303]sequential analysis) to assist in
   breaking the naval Enigma, "though I was not sure that it would work in
   practice, and was not, in fact, sure until some days had actually
   broken."^[304][69] For this, he invented a measure of weight of
   evidence that he called the [305]ban. Banburismus could rule out
   certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time
   needed to test settings on the bombes.

   In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to Hut 8 colleague [306]Joan Clarke,
   a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was
   short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was
   reportedly "unfazed" by the revelation, Turing decided that he could
   not go through with the marriage.^[307][71]

   Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942^[308][72] and
   worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on the naval Enigma and bombe
   construction in Washington; he also visited their [309]Computing
   Machine Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio. His reaction to the American bombe
   design was far from enthusiastic:

     The American Bombe programme was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each
     wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of Bombe hut
     routine implied by this programme, but thought that no particular
     purpose would be served by pointing out that we would not really use
     them in that way. Their test (of commutators) can hardly be
     considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with
     electronic stop finding devices. Nobody seems to be told about rods
     or offiziers or banburismus unless they are really going to do
     something about it.^[310][73]

   -- Alan Turing

   During this trip, he also assisted at [311]Bell Labs with the
   development of [312]secure speech devices.^[313][74] He returned to
   Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, [314]Hugh Alexander
   had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although
   Alexander had been de facto head for some time (Turing having little
   interest in the day-to-day running of the section). Turing became a
   general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

   Alexander wrote as follows about his contribution:

     There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was
     the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days, he was the
     only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not
     only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work
     within the Hut, but he also shared with Welchman and Keen the chief
     credit for the invention of the bombe. It is always difficult to say
     that anyone is 'absolutely indispensable', but if anyone was
     indispensable to Hut 8, it was Turing. The pioneer's work always
     tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make
     everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude
     of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside
     world.^[315][75]

   -- Hugh Alexander

Turingery[[316]edit]

   In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed [317]Turingery (or
   jokingly Turingismus)^[318][76] for use against the [319]Lorenz cipher
   messages produced by the Germans' new Geheimschreiber (secret writer)
   machine. This was a [320]teleprinter [321]rotor cipher attachment
   codenamed Tunny at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of
   wheel-breaking, i.e., a procedure for working out the cam settings of
   Tunny's wheels.^[322][77] He also introduced the Tunny team to
   [323]Tommy Flowers who, under the guidance of [324]Max Newman, went on
   to build the [325]Colossus computer, the world's first programmable
   digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine
   (the [326]Heath Robinson), and whose superior speed allowed the
   statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the
   messages.^[327][78] Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key
   figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the
   statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking
   about [328]cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher,^[329][79]^[330][80] but
   he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.^[331][81]

Delilah[[332]edit]

   Following his work at Bell Labs in the US,^[333][82] Turing pursued the
   idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system, and
   in the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret
   Service's Radio Security Service (later [334]HMGCC) at [335]Hanslope
   Park. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the
   assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the
   design and construction of a portable [336]secure voice communications
   machine codenamed Delilah.^[337][83] It was intended for different
   applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio
   transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be
   used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing
   demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording
   of a [338]Winston Churchill speech, Delilah was not adopted for
   use.^[339][84] Turing also consulted with Bell Labs on the development
   of [340]SIGSALY, a secure voice system that was used in the later years
   of the war.

Early computers and the Turing test[[341]edit]

   Plaque, 78 High Street, [342]Hampton

   From 1945 to 1947, Turing lived in [343]Hampton, London,^[344][85]
   while he worked on the design of the [345]ACE (Automatic Computing
   Engine) at the [346]National Physical Laboratory (NPL). He presented a
   paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a
   [347]stored-program computer.^[348][86] [349]Von Neumann's incomplete
   [350]First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC had predated Turing's paper,
   but it was much less detailed and, according to [351]John R. Womersley,
   Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it "contains a number
   of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own".^[352][87] Although ACE was a
   feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley
   Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned.
   In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during
   which he produced a seminal work on Intelligent Machinery that was not
   published in his lifetime.^[353][88] While he was at Cambridge, the
   [354]Pilot ACE was being built in his absence. It executed its first
   program on 10 May 1950, and a number of later computers around the
   world owe much to it, including the [355]English Electric DEUCE and the
   American [356]Bendix G-15. The full version of Turing's ACE was not
   built until after his death.^[357][89]

   According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer [358]Heinz
   Billing from the [359]Max Planck Institute for Physics, published by
   Genscher, Düsseldorf, there was a meeting between Alan Turing and
   [360]Konrad Zuse.^[361][90] It took place in [362]Göttingen in 1947.
   The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were
   [363]Womersley, Turing, Porter from England and a few German
   researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see
   Herbert Bruderer, Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz).

   In 1948 Turing was appointed [364]Reader in the [365]Mathematics
   Department at the [366]Victoria University of Manchester. In 1949, he
   became Deputy Director of the Computing Machine Laboratory there,
   working on software for one of the earliest [367]stored-program
   computers--the [368]Manchester Mark 1. During this time he continued to
   do more abstract work in mathematics,^[369][91] and in "[370]Computing
   Machinery and Intelligence" ([371]Mind, October 1950), Turing addressed
   the problem of [372]artificial intelligence, and proposed an experiment
   that became known as the [373]Turing test, an attempt to define a
   standard for a machine to be called "intelligent". The idea was that a
   computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator could not
   tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.^[374][92] In
   the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to
   simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler
   one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of
   education. A [375]reversed form of the Turing test is widely used on
   the Internet; the [376]CAPTCHA test is intended to determine whether
   the user is a human or a computer.

   In 1948 Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague,
   [377]D. G. Champernowne, began writing a [378]chess program for a
   computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and
   dubbed the Turochamp.^[379][93] In 1952, he tried to implement it on a
   [380]Ferranti Mark 1, but lacking enough power, the computer was unable
   to execute the program. Instead, Turing played a game in which he
   simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. The game
   was recorded.^[381][94] The program lost to Turing's colleague
   [382]Alick Glennie, although it is said that it won a game against
   Champernowne's wife.

   His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative and
   lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence,
   which continues after more than half a century.^[383][95] He also
   invented the [384]LU decomposition method in 1948,^[385][91] used today
   for solving matrix equations.^[386][96]

Pattern formation and mathematical biology[[387]edit]

   Towards the end of his life, Turing turned to [388]mathematical
   biology, publishing the "[389]The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" in
   1952. He was interested in [390]morphogenesis, the development of
   patterns and shapes in biological organisms. His central interest in
   the field was understanding Fibonacci [391]phyllotaxis, the existence
   of [392]Fibonacci numbers in plant structures.^[393][97] He suggested
   that a system of chemicals reacting with each other and diffusing
   across space, termed a [394]reaction-diffusion system, could account
   for "the main phenomena of morphogenesis".^[395][98] Instability in the
   system of [396]partial differential equations used to model the system
   allows for small random perturbations to homogeneous initial state to
   drive the development of patterns. Though published before even the
   structure or role of [397]DNA was understood, Turing's work on
   morphogenesis remains relevant today, and is considered a seminal piece
   of work in mathematical biology.^[398][99] Experiments suggest that
   Turing's work can partially explain growth of "feathers, hair
   follicles, the branching pattern of lungs, and even the left-right
   asymmetry that puts the heart on the left side of the
   chest."^[399][100] In 2012, Sheth, et al. found that in mice, removal
   of Hox genes causes an increase in the number of digits without an
   increase in the overall size of the limb, suggesting that Hox genes
   control digit formation by tuning the wavelength of a Turing-type
   mechanism.^[400][101] Later papers, though promised, were not available
   until Collected Works of A. M. Turing was published in 1992.^[401][102]

Conviction for indecency[[402]edit]

   In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold
   Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing had met Murray just before
   Christmas outside the [403]Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester's
   [404]Oxford Road and invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing's house
   was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of
   his, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the
   investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray.
   Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that
   time,^[405][103] and both men were charged with [406]gross indecency
   under [407]Section 11 of the [408]Criminal Law Amendment Act
   1885.^[409][104] Initial [410]committal proceedings for the trial were
   held on 27 February during which Turing's solicitor "reserved his
   defence", i.e. did not argue or provide evidence against the
   allegations.

   Later, convinced by the advice of his brother and his own solicitor,
   Turing entered a plea of guilty.^[411][105] The case, [412]Regina v.
   Turing and Murray, was brought to trial on 31 March 1952.^[413][106]
   Turing was convicted and given a choice between imprisonment and
   probation, which would be conditional on his agreement to undergo
   [414]hormonal treatment designed to reduce [415]libido. He accepted the
   option of treatment via injections of what was then called stilboestrol
   (now known as [416]diethylstilbestrol or DES), a synthetic
   [417]oestrogen; this treatment was continued for the course of one
   year. The treatment rendered Turing [418]impotent and caused
   [419]gynaecomastia,^[420][107] fulfilling in the literal sense Turing's
   prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man,
   but quite who I've not found out".^[421][108]^[422][109] Murray was
   given a conditional discharge.^[423][110]

   Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and
   barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the
   [424]Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British
   [425]signals intelligence agency that had evolved from GC&CS in 1946
   (though he kept his academic job). He was denied entry into the United
   States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other
   European countries. At the time, there was acute public anxiety about
   homosexual entrapment of spies by Soviet agents,^[426][111] because of
   the recent exposure of the first two members of the [427]Cambridge
   Five, [428]Guy Burgess and [429]Donald Maclean, as [430]KGB [431]double
   agents. Turing was never accused of espionage, but in common with all
   who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the [432]Official
   Secrets Act from discussing his war work.^[433][112]

Death[[434]edit]

   On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the
   previous day. A [435]post-mortem examination established that the cause
   of death was [436]cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered, an
   apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not
   tested for cyanide,^[437][113] it was speculated that this was the
   means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An [438]inquest determined
   that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at [439]Woking
   Crematorium on 12 June 1954.^[440][114] Turing's ashes were scattered
   there, just as his father's had been. Andrew Hodges and another
   biographer, [441]David Leavitt, have both suggested that Turing was
   re-enacting a scene from the [442]Walt Disney film [443]Snow White and
   the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale, both noting that (in
   Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene
   where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous
   brew".^[444][115]

Alternative death theories[[445]edit]

   Philosophy professor [446]Jack Copeland has questioned various aspects
   of the coroner's historical verdict. He suggests an alternative
   explanation for the cause of Turing's death, this being the accidental
   inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for gold
   [447]electroplating spoons, which uses potassium cyanide to
   [448]dissolve the gold. Turing had such an apparatus set up in his tiny
   spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more
   consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing
   also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it
   to be discarded half-eaten.^[449][116] In addition, Turing had
   reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had
   been discontinued a year previously) "with good humour" and had shown
   no sign of despondency prior to his death, setting down, in fact, a
   list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after
   the holiday weekend.^[450][116] At the time, Turing's mother believed
   that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless
   storage of laboratory chemicals.^[451][117] Biographer Andrew Hodges
   suggests that Turing may have arranged the cyanide experiment
   deliberately, to give his mother some [452]plausible
   deniability.^[453][118]

Recognition and tributes[[454]edit]

   Alan Turing's OBE currently held in [455]Sherborne School archives

   A biography published by the [456]Royal Society shortly after Turing's
   death, while his wartime work was still subject to the [457]Official
   Secrets Act, recorded:

     Three remarkable papers written just before the war, on three
     diverse mathematical subjects, show the quality of the work that
     might have been produced if he had settled down to work on some big
     problem at that critical time. For his work at the Foreign Office he
     was awarded the OBE.^[458][2]

   Since 1966, the [459]Turing Award has been given annually by the
   [460]Association for Computing Machinery for technical or theoretical
   contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered to be
   the computing world's highest honour, equivalent to the Nobel
   Prize.^[461][119]
   A [462]blue plaque marking Turing's home at [463]Wilmslow, Cheshire

   On 23 June 1998, on what would have been Turing's 86th birthday, his
   biographer, [464]Andrew Hodges, unveiled an official [465]English
   Heritage [466]blue plaque at his birthplace and childhood home in
   Warrington Crescent, London, later the Colonnade
   Hotel.^[467][120]^[468][121] To mark the 50th anniversary of his death,
   a memorial plaque was unveiled on 7 June 2004 at his former residence,
   Hollymeade, in [469]Wilmslow, Cheshire.^[470][122]

   On 13 March 2000, [471]Saint Vincent and the Grenadines issued a set of
   postage stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th
   century, one of which carries a portrait of Turing against a background
   of repeated 0s and 1s, and is captioned: "1937: Alan Turing's theory of
   digital computing". On 1 April 2003, Turing's work at [472]Bletchley
   Park was named an [473]IEEE Milestone.^[474][123] On 28 October 2004, a
   bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by [475]John W. Mills was
   unveiled at the [476]University of Surrey in [477]Guildford, marking
   the 50th anniversary of Turing's death; it portrays him carrying his
   books across the campus.^[478][124]

   Turing was one of four mathematicians examined in the BBC documentary
   entitled Dangerous Knowledge (2008).^[479][125] The [480]Princeton
   Alumni Weekly named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the
   history of [481]Princeton University, second only to President
   [482]James Madison. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled
   on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a
   million pieces of Welsh [483]slate, it was sculpted by [484]Stephen
   Kettle, having been commissioned by the American billionaire
   [485]Sidney Frank.^[486][126]

   Turing has been honoured in various ways in [487]Manchester, the city
   where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the
   [488]A6010 road (the [489]Manchester city intermediate ring road) was
   named "Alan Turing Way". A bridge carrying this road was widened, and
   carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A [490]statue of Turing was
   unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in [491]Sackville Park, between
   the University of Manchester building on Whitworth Street and
   [492]Canal Street. The memorial statue depicts the "father of computer
   science" sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing
   is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the
   text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912-1954', and the motto 'Founder of
   Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an [493]Enigma
   machine: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'.
   Turing memorial statue plaque in Sackville Park, Manchester

   A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science,
   mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'.
   There is also a [494]Bertrand Russell quotation: "Mathematics, rightly
   viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty -- a beauty cold
   and austere, like that of sculpture." The sculptor buried his own old
   [495]Amstrad computer under the [496]plinth as a tribute to "the
   godfather of all modern computers".^[497][127]

   In 1999, [498]Time magazine named Turing as one of the [499]100 Most
   Important People of the 20th century and stated, "The fact remains that
   everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a
   word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing
   machine."^[500][3]

   In 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the BBC's poll of the
   [501]100 Greatest Britons following a UK-wide vote.^[502][128] In 2006,
   British writer and mathematician [503]Ioan James chose Turing as one of
   twenty people to feature in his book about famous historical figures
   who may have had some of the traits of [504]Asperger
   syndrome.^[505][129] In 2010, actor/playwright [506]Jade Esteban
   Estrada portrayed Turing in the solo musical, ICONS: The Lesbian and
   Gay History of the World, Vol. 4. In 2011, in [507]The Guardian's "My
   hero" series, writer [508]Alan Garner chose Turing as his hero and
   described how they had met whilst out jogging in the early 1950s.
   Garner remembered Turing as "funny and witty" and said that he "talked
   endlessly".^[509][130] In 2006, Alan Turing was named with online
   resources as an LGBT History Month Icon.^[510][131] In 2006, Boston
   [511]Pride named Turing their Honorary Grand Marshal.^[512][132]
   Alan Turing memorial statue in [513]Sackville Park, Manchester

   The logo of [514]Apple Inc. is often erroneously referred to as a
   tribute to Alan Turing, with the bite mark a reference to his
   death.^[515][133] Both the designer of the logo^[516][134] and the
   company deny that there is any homage to Turing in the
   design.^[517][135]^[518][136] [519]Stephen Fry has recounted asking
   [520]Steve Jobs whether the design was intentional, saying that Jobs'
   response was, "God, we wish it were."^[521][137] In February 2011,
   Turing's papers from the Second World War were bought for the nation
   with an 11th-hour bid by the [522]National Heritage Memorial Fund,
   allowing them to stay at Bletchley Park.^[523][138]

   In 2012, Turing was inducted into the [524]Legacy Walk, an outdoor
   public display that celebrates LGBT history and
   people.^[525][139]^[526][140]

   The francophone singer-songwriter [527]Salvatore Adamo made a tribute
   to Turing with his song "Alan et la Pomme".^[528][141] Turing's life
   and work featured in a BBC children's programme about famous
   scientists - [529]Absolute Genius with Dick and Dom - first broadcast
   on 12 March 2014.

   On 17 May 2014, the world's first work of public art to recognise Alan
   Turing as gay was commissioned in Bletchley, close by to Bletchley Park
   where his war-time work was carried out. The commission was announced
   by the owners of [530]Milton Keynes-based LGBT venue and nightclub Pink
   Punters to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.
   The work was unveiled at a ceremony on Turing's birthday, 23 June 2014,
   and is placed outside Pink Punter's alongside the busy Watling Street,
   the old main road to London where Turing himself would have passed by
   on many occasions. On 22 October 2014, Turing was inducted into the
   [531]NSA Hall of Honor.^[532][142]^[533][143]

Government apology and pardon[[610]edit]

   In August 2009, [611]John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the
   British Government to apologise for Turing's prosecution as a
   homosexual.^[612][166]^[613][167] The petition received more than
   30,000 signatures.^[614][168]^[615][169] Prime Minister [616]Gordon
   Brown acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September
   2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as
   "appalling":^[617][168]^[618][170]

     Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan
     Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While
     Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the
     clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am
     pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are
     for what happened to him ... So on behalf of the British government,
     and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud
     to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much
     better.^[619][168]^[620][171]

   In December 2011, William Jones created an [621]e-petition^[622][172]
   requesting the British Government [623]pardon Turing for his conviction
   of "gross indecency":^[624][173]

     We ask the HM Government to grant a pardon to Alan Turing for the
     conviction of "gross indecency". In 1952, he was convicted of "gross
     indecency" with another man and was forced to undergo so-called
     "organo-therapy" - chemical castration. Two years later, he killed
     himself with cyanide, aged just 41. Alan Turing was driven to a
     terrible despair and early death by the nation he'd done so much to
     save. This remains a shame on the [625]British government and
     British history. A pardon can go some way to healing this damage. It
     may act as an apology to many of the other gay men, not as
     well-known as Alan Turing, who were subjected to these
     laws.^[626][172]

   The petition gathered over 37,000 signatures,^[627][11]^[628][172] but
   the request was discouraged by [629]Lord McNally, who gave the
   following opinion in his role as the Justice Minister:^[630][174]

     A posthumous pardon was not considered appropriate as Alan Turing
     was properly convicted of what at the time was a criminal offence.
     He would have known that his offence was against the law and that he
     would be prosecuted. It is tragic that Alan Turing was convicted of
     an offence that now seems both cruel and absurd--particularly
     poignant given his outstanding contribution to the war effort.
     However, the law at the time required a prosecution and, as such,
     long-standing policy has been to accept that such convictions took
     place and, rather than trying to alter the historical context and to
     put right what cannot be put right, ensure instead that we never
     again return to those times.^[631][175]

   [632]John Leech, the MP for [633]Manchester Withington (2005-15),
   submitted several bills to Parliament^[634][176] and campaigned with
   William Jones to secure the pardon. Leech made the case in the House of
   Commons that Turing's contribution to the war made him a national hero
   and that it was "ultimately just embarrassing" that the conviction
   still stood.^[635][177] Leech continued to take the bill through
   Parliament and campaigned for several years until it was
   passed.^[636][178]

   On 26 July 2012, a bill was introduced in the [637]House of Lords to
   grant a statutory pardon to Turing for offences under section 11 of the
   Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, of which he was convicted on 31 March
   1952.^[638][179] Late in the year in a letter to [639]The Daily
   Telegraph, the physicist [640]Stephen Hawking and 10 other signatories
   including the [641]Astronomer Royal [642]Lord Rees, [643]President of
   the Royal Society Sir [644]Paul Nurse, [645]Lady Trumpington (who
   worked for Turing during the war) and [646]Lord Sharkey (the bill's
   sponsor) called on Prime Minister [647]David Cameron to act on the
   pardon request.^[648][180] The Government indicated it would support
   the bill,^[649][181]^[650][182]^[651][183] and it passed its third
   reading in the Lords in October.^[652][184]
   Wikinews has related news: [653]Alan Turing given posthumous pardon

   Before the bill could be debated in the [654]House of
   Commons,^[655][185] the Government elected to proceed under the
   [656]royal prerogative of mercy. On 24 December 2013, [657]Queen
   Elizabeth II signed a pardon^[658][10] for Turing's conviction for
   gross indecency, with immediate effect. Announcing the pardon, Justice
   Secretary [659]Chris Grayling said Turing deserved to be "remembered
   and recognised for his fantastic contribution to the war effort" and
   not for his later criminal conviction.^[660][9]^[661][11] The Queen
   officially pronounced Turing pardoned in August 2014.^[662][186] The
   Queen's action is only the fourth royal pardon granted since the
   conclusion of the Second World War.^[663][187] This case is unusual in
   that pardons are normally granted only when the person is technically
   innocent, and a request has been made by the family or other interested
   party. Neither condition was met in regard to Turing's
   conviction.^[664][188]

   In a letter to Prime Minister [665]David Cameron after announcement of
   the pardon, human rights advocate [666]Peter Tatchell criticised the
   decision to single out Turing due to his fame and achievements, when
   thousands of others convicted under the same law have not received
   pardons.^[667][189] Tatchell also called for a new investigation into
   Turing's death:

     A new inquiry is long overdue, even if only to dispel any doubts
     about the true cause of his death - including speculation that he
     was murdered by the security services (or others). I think murder by
     state agents is unlikely. There is no known evidence pointing to any
     such act. However, it is a major failing that this possibility has
     never been considered or investigated.^[668][190]

   In 2016, the government announced its intention to expand this
   retroactive exoneration to other men convicted of similar historical
   indecency offenses, in what has been described as an "[669]Alan Turing
   law".^[670][191]^[671][192]

Centenary celebrations[[672]edit]

   Main article: [673]Alan Turing Year
   [674]David Chalmers on stage for an Alan Turing Year conference at
   [675]De La Salle University, Manila, 27 March 2012

   To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary
   Advisory Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the [676]Alan Turing Year, a
   year-long programme of events around the world honouring Turing's life
   and achievements. The TCAC, chaired by [677]S. Barry Cooper with Alan
   Turing's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President,
   worked with the University of Manchester faculty members and a broad
   spectrum of people from Cambridge University and [678]Bletchley Park.

   On 23 June 2012, [679]Google featured an interactive [680]doodle where
   visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine, so when
   run, the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence, featuring
   "Google" in [681]Baudot-Murray code.^[682][193]

   The Bletchley Park Trust collaborated with [683]Winning Moves to
   publish an Alan Turing edition of the board game [684]Monopoly. The
   game's squares and cards have been revised to tell the story of Alan
   Turing's life, from his birthplace in Maida Vale to Hut 8 at Bletchley
   Park.^[685][194] The game also includes a replica of an original
   hand-drawn board created by [686]William Newman, son of Turing's
   mentor, [687]Max Newman, which Turing played on in the
   1950s.^[688][195]

   In the [689]Philippines, the [690]Department of Philosophy at [691]De
   La Salle University-Manila hosted Turing 2012, an international
   conference on philosophy, artificial intelligence, and cognitive
   science from 27 to 28 March 2012 to commemorate the centenary birth of
   Turing.^[692][196]^[693][197] [694]Madurai, India held celebrations
   with a programme attended by 6,000 students.^[695][198]

UK celebrations[[696]edit]

   The [697]London 2012 [698]Olympic Torch flame was passed on in front of
   Turing's statue in Manchester on his 100th birthday.

   There was a three-day conference in Manchester in June, a two-day
   conference in San Francisco, organised by the ACM, and a birthday party
   and Turing Centenary Conference in Cambridge organised at [699]King's
   College, Cambridge, and the University of Cambridge, the latter
   organised by the association [700]Computability in Europe.^[701][199]

   The [702]Science Museum in London launched a free exhibition devoted to
   Turing's life and achievements in June 2012, to run until July
   2013.^[703][200] In February 2012, the [704]Royal Mail issued a stamp
   featuring Turing as part of its "Britons of Distinction"
   series.^[705][201] The [706]London 2012 [707]Olympic Torch flame was
   passed on in front of Turing's statue in [708]Sackville Gardens,
   Manchester, on the evening of 23 June 2012, the 100th anniversary of
   his birth.

   On 22 June 2012 [709]Manchester City Council, in partnership with the
   [710]Lesbian and Gay Foundation, launched the Alan Turing Memorial
   Award, which will recognise individuals or groups who have made a
   significant contribution to the fight against homophobia in
   Manchester.^[711][202]

   At the [712]University of Oxford, a new course in [713]Computer Science
   and Philosophy was established to coincide with the centenary of
   Turing's birth.^[714][203]

   Previous events have included a celebration of Turing's life and
   achievements, at the University of Manchester, arranged by the British
   Logic Colloquium and the [715]British Society for the History of
   Mathematics on 5 June 2004.^[716][204]

Theatre[[724]edit]

   [725]Benedict Cumberbatch portrayed Turing in the 2014 film [726]The
   Imitation Game
     * [727]Breaking the Code is a 1986 play by [728]Hugh Whitemore about
       Alan Turing. The play ran in [729]London's West End beginning in
       November 1986 and on Broadway from 15 November 1987 to 10 April
       1988. There was also a 1996 [730]BBC television production
       (broadcast in the United States by [731]PBS). In all three
       performances Turing was played by [732]Derek Jacobi. The Broadway
       production was nominated for three [733]Tony Awards including Best
       Actor in a Play, Best Featured Actor in a Play, and Best Direction
       of a Play, and for two [734]Drama Desk Awards, for Best Actor and
       Best Featured Actor. Turing was again portrayed by Jacobi in the
       1996 television film adaptation of Breaking the Code.^[735][205]
     * In 2012, in honour of the Turing Centennial, [736]American Lyric
       Theater commissioned an operatic exploration of the life and death
       of Alan Turing from composer Justine F. Chen and librettist David
       Simpatico.^[737][206] Titled The Life and Death(s) of Alan Turing,
       the opera is a historical fantasia on the life of the brilliant
       scientist. The opera will receive a concert performance in October
       2015 in New York City. In November 2014, the opera and several
       other artistic works inspired by Turing's life were featured on
       [738]Studio 360.^[739][207]

Literature[[740]edit]

       jurisdiction over AIs. (1984) ^[743][208]
     * Turing is featured in the [744]Neal Stephenson novel
       [745]Cryptonomicon (1999).^[746][209]
     * The 2006 novel [747]A Madman Dreams of Turing Machines contrasts
       fictionalised accounts of the lives and ideas of Turing and
       [748]Kurt Gödel.^[749][210]
     * The 2015 novel [750]Speak, written by [751]Louisa Hall, includes a
       series of fictional letters written from Turing to his best
       friend's mother throughout his life, detailing his research about
       artificial intelligence.^[752][211]^[753][212]

Music[[754]edit]

     * Electronic music duo [755]Matmos released an EP titled For Alan
       Turing in 2006, which was based on material commissioned by Dr.
       Robert Osserman and David Elsenbud of the [756]Mathematical
       Sciences Research Institute.^[757][213] In one of its tracks, an
       original Enigma Machine is sampled.^[758][214]
     * In 2012, Spanish group [759]Hidrogenesse dedicated their LP Un
       dígito binario dudoso. Recital para Alan Turing (A dubious binary
       digit. Concert for Alan Turing) to the memory of the
       mathematician.^[760][215]
     * A musical work inspired by Turing's life, written by [761]Neil
       Tennant and [762]Chris Lowe of the [763]Pet Shop Boys, entitled A
       Man from the Future, was announced in late 2013.^[764][216] It was
       performed by the Pet Shop Boys and [765]Juliet Stevenson
       (narrator), the BBC Singers, and the BBC Concert Orchestra
       conducted by Dominic Wheeler at the [766]BBC Proms in the Royal
       Albert Hall on 23 July 2014.^[767][217]
     * Codebreaker is also the title of a choral work by the composer
       James McCarthy. It includes settings of texts by the poets
       [768]Wilfred Owen, [769]Sara Teasdale, [770]Walt Whitman,
       [771]Oscar Wilde and [772]Robert Burns that are used to illustrate
       aspects of Turing's life. It was premiered on 26 April 2014 at the
       [773]Barbican Centre in London, where it was performed by the
       [774]Hertfordshire Chorus, who commissioned the work, led by
       [775]David Temple with the soprano soloist Naomi Harvey providing
       the voice of Turing's mother.^[776][218]^[777][219]

       1959, and so could not cover his war work. Scarcely 300 copies were

       includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was
       re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the
       centenary of his birth, and included a new foreword by [1464]Martin
       Davis, as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing's older
