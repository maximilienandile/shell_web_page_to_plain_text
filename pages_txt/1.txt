   PowerShell (including Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core) is a task
   automation and configuration management framework from [51]Microsoft,
   consisting of a [52]command-line [53]shell and associated [54]scripting
   language built on the [55].NET Framework. PowerShell provides full
   access to [56]COM and [57]WMI, enabling administrators to perform
   administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems as well
   as [58]WS-Management and [59]CIM enabling management of remote Linux
   systems and network devices. Initially a Windows component only,
   PowerShell was made [60]open-source and [61]cross-platform on 18 August
   2016.^[62][3]

   In PowerShell, administrative tasks are generally performed by cmdlets
   (pronounced command-lets), which are specialized .NET [63]classes
   implementing a particular operation. Sets of cmdlets may be combined
   into scripts, executables (which are standalone applications), or by
   instantiating regular .NET classes (or WMI/COM
   Objects).^[64][4]^[65][5] These work by accessing data in different
   data stores, like the [66]file system or [67]registry, which are made
   available to the PowerShell runtime via PowerShell providers.

   PowerShell also provides a hosting [68]API with which the PowerShell
   runtime can be embedded inside other applications. These applications
   can then use PowerShell functionality to implement certain operations,
   including those exposed via the [69]graphical interface. This
   capability has been used by [70]Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 to
   expose its management functionality as PowerShell cmdlets and providers
   and implement the [71]graphical management tools as PowerShell hosts
   which invoke the necessary cmdlets.^[72][4]^[73][6] Other Microsoft
   applications including [74]Microsoft SQL Server 2008 also expose their
   management interface via PowerShell cmdlets.^[75][7]

   PowerShell includes its own extensive, console-based help, similar to
   [76]man pages in [77]Unix shells, via the Get-Help cmdlet. Local help
   contents can be retrieved from the Internet via Update-Help cmdlet.
   Alternatively, help from the web can be acquired on a case-by-case
   basis via the -online switch to Get-Help.

Background[[100]edit]

   Every released version of [101]Microsoft DOS and [102]Microsoft Windows
   for [103]personal computers has included a command-line interface tool
   ([104]shell). These are [105]COMMAND.COM (in installations relying on
   [106]MS-DOS, including [107]Windows 9x) and [108]cmd.exe (in
   [109]Windows NT family operating systems). The shell is a [110]command
   line interpreter that supports a few basic commands. For other
   purposes, a separate [111]console application must be invoked from the
   shell. The shell also includes a scripting language ([112]batch files),
   which can be used to automate various tasks. However, the shell cannot
   be used to automate all facets of [113]GUI functionality, in part
   because command-line equivalents of operations exposed via the
   graphical interface are limited, and the scripting language is
   elementary and does not allow the creation of complex scripts. In
   [114]Windows Server 2003, the situation was improved, but scripting
   support was still considered unsatisfactory.^[115][8]

   Microsoft attempted to address some of these shortcomings by
   introducing the [116]Windows Script Host in 1998 with [117]Windows 98,
   and its command-line based host: cscript.exe. It integrates with the
   [118]Active Script engine and allows scripts to be written in
   compatible languages, such as [119]JScript and [120]VBScript,
   leveraging the [121]APIs exposed by applications via [122]COM. However,
   it has its own deficiencies: it is not integrated with the shell, its
   documentation is not very accessible, and it quickly gained a
   reputation as a system [123]vulnerability vector after several
   high-profile [124]computer viruses exploited weaknesses in its security
   provisions. Different versions of Windows provided various
   special-purpose command line interpreters (such as [125]netsh and
   [126]WMIC) with their own command sets. None of them were integrated
   with the command shell; nor were they interoperable.

   By 2002 Microsoft had started to develop a new approach to command line
   management, including a shell called Monad (also known as Microsoft
   Shell or MSH). The shell and the ideas behind it were published in
   August 2002 in a white paper entitled Monad Manifesto.^[127][9] Monad
   was to be a new extensible command shell with a fresh design that would
   be capable of automating a full range of core administrative tasks.
   Microsoft first showed off Monad at the Professional Development
   Conference in Los Angeles in October 2003. A private beta program began
   a few months later which eventually led to a public beta program.

   Microsoft published the first Monad public [128]beta release on June
   17, 2005, Beta 2 on September 11, 2005, and Beta 3 on January 10, 2006.
   Not much later, on April 25, 2006 Microsoft formally announced that
   Monad had been renamed Windows PowerShell, positioning it as a
   significant part of their management technology offerings.^[129][10]
   Release Candidate 1 of PowerShell was released at the same time. A
   significant aspect of both the name change and the RC was that this was
   now a component of Windows, and not an add-on product.

   Release Candidate 2 of PowerShell version 1 was released on September
   26, 2006 with final Release to the web (RTW) on November 14, 2006 and
   announced at TechEd Barcelona. PowerShell for earlier versions of
   Windows was released on January 30, 2007.^[130][11]

   PowerShell v2.0 development began before PowerShell v1.0 shipped.
   During the development, Microsoft shipped three [131]community
   technology preview (CTP). Microsoft made these releases available to
   the public. The last CTP release of Windows PowerShell v2.0 was made
   available in December 2008.
   PowerShell for Linux 6.0 Alpha 9 on [132]Ubuntu 14.04 x64

   PowerShell v2.0 was completed and released to manufacturing in August
   2009, as an integral part of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
   Versions of PowerShell for Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows
   Vista and Windows Server 2008 were released in October 2009 and are
   available for download for both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms.^[133][12]

   Windows 10 shipped a testing framework for PowerShell.^[134][13]

   On 18 August 2016, Microsoft announced^[135][14] that they had made
   PowerShell open-source and cross-platform with support for Windows,
   [136]OS X, [137]CentOS and [138]Ubuntu.^[139][3] The source code was
   published on [140]GitHub. ^[141][15] The move to open source created a
   second incarnation of PowerShell called "PowerShell Core", which runs
   on [142].NET Core. It is distinct from "Windows PowerShell", which runs
   on the full [143].NET Framework.^[144][16] PowerShell Core will be
   shipped with [145]Windows Server 2016 Nano Server.^[146][17]

Design[[147]edit]

   PowerShell's developers based the core grammar of the tool on that of
   [148]POSIX 1003.2.^[149][18]

   Windows PowerShell can execute four kinds of named commands:^[150][19]
     * cmdlets ([151].NET Framework programs designed to interact with
       PowerShell)
     * PowerShell scripts (files suffixed by .ps1)
     * PowerShell functions
     * standalone [152]executable programs

   If a command is a standalone executable program, PowerShell.exe
   launches it in a separate [153]process; if it is a cmdlet, it executes
   in the PowerShell process. PowerShell provides an interactive
   [154]command-line interface, wherein the commands can be entered and
   their output displayed. The user interface, based on the [155]Win32
   console, offers customizable [156]tab completion. PowerShell enables
   the creation of [157]aliases for cmdlets, which PowerShell textually
   translates into invocations of the original commands. PowerShell
   supports both [158]named and positional [159]parameters for commands.
   In executing a cmdlet, the job of binding the argument value to the
   parameter is done by PowerShell itself, but for external executables,
   arguments are parsed by the external executable independently of
   PowerShell interpretation.^[[160]citation needed]

   The PowerShell Extended Type System (ETS) is based on the .NET type
   system, but with extended semantics (for example, propertySets and
   third-party extensibility). For example, it enables the creation of
   different views of objects by exposing only a subset of the data
   fields, properties, and methods, as well as specifying custom
   formatting and sorting behavior. These views are mapped to the original
   object using [161]XML-based configuration files.^[162][20]

Cmdlets[[163]edit]

   Cmdlets are specialized commands in the PowerShell environment that
   implement specific functions. These are the native commands in the
   PowerShell stack. Cmdlets follow a Verb-Noun naming pattern, such as
   Get-ChildItem, helping to make them self-descriptive.^[164][21] Cmdlets
   output their results as objects or as collections thereof (including
   arrays), and can optionally receive input in that form, making them
   suitable for use as recipients in a pipeline. But whereas PowerShell
   allows arrays and other collections of objects to be written to the
   pipeline, cmdlets always process objects individually. For collections
   of objects, PowerShell invokes the cmdlet on each object in the
   collection, in sequence.^[165][21]

   Cmdlets are specialized .NET [166]classes, which the PowerShell runtime
   instantiates and invokes at run-time. Cmdlets derive either from Cmdlet
   or from PSCmdlet, the latter being used when the cmdlet needs to
   interact with the PowerShell runtime.^[167][21] These base classes
   specify certain methods - BeginProcessing(), ProcessRecord() and
   EndProcessing() - which the cmdlet's implementation overrides to
   provide the functionality. Whenever a cmdlet runs, PowerShell invokes
   these methods in sequence, with ProcessRecord() being called if it
   receives pipeline input.^[168][22] If a collection of objects is piped,
   the method is invoked for each object in the collection. The class
   implementing the Cmdlet must have one .NET [169]attribute -
   CmdletAttribute - which specifies the verb and the noun that make up
   the name of the cmdlet. Common verbs are provided as an
   [170]enum.>^[171][23]^[172][24]

   If a cmdlet receives either pipeline input or command-line parameter
   input, there must be a corresponding [173]property in the class, with a
   [174]mutator implementation. PowerShell invokes the mutator with the
   parameter value or pipeline input, which is saved by the mutator
   implementation in class variables. These values are then referred to by
   the methods which implement the functionality. Properties that map to
   command-line parameters are marked by ParameterAttribute^[175][25] and
   are set before the call to BeginProcessing(). Those which map to
   pipeline input are also flanked by ParameterAttribute, but with the
   ValueFromPipeline attribute parameter set.^[176][26]

   The implementation of these cmdlet classes can refer to any [177].NET
   [178]API and may be in any [179].NET language. In addition, PowerShell
   makes certain APIs available, such as WriteObject(), which is used to
   access PowerShell-specific functionality, such as writing resultant
   objects to the pipeline. Cmdlets can use .NET data access [180]APIs
   directly or use the PowerShell infrastructure of PowerShell Providers,
   which make data stores addressable using unique [181]paths. Data stores
   are exposed using drive letters, and hierarchies within them, addressed
   as directories. Windows PowerShell ships with providers for the
   [182]file system, [183]registry, the [184]certificate store, as well as
   the namespaces for command aliases, variables, and functions.^[185][27]
   Windows PowerShell also includes various cmdlets for managing various
   [186]Windows systems, including the [187]file system, or using
   [188]Windows Management Instrumentation to control [189]Windows
   components. Other applications can register cmdlets with PowerShell,
   thus allowing it to manage them, and, if they enclose any datastore
   (such as databases), they can add specific providers as
   well.^[[190]citation needed]

   PowerShell V2 added a more portable version of Cmdlets called Modules.
   The PowerShell V2 release notes state:

     "Modules allow script developers and administrators to partition and
     organize their Windows PowerShell code in self-contained, reusable
     units. Code from a module executes in its own self-contained context
     and does not affect the state outside of the module. Modules also
     enable you to define a restricted runspace environment by using a
     script."^[[191]citation needed]

Pipeline[[192]edit]

   PowerShell implements the concept of a pipeline, which enables piping
   the output of one cmdlet to another cmdlet as input. For example, the
   output of the Get-Process cmdlet could be piped to the Where-Object to
   filter any process that has less than 1 MB of paged memory, and then to
   the Sort-Object cmdlet (e.g., to sort the objects by handle count), and
   then finally to the Select-Object cmdlet to select just the first 10
   (i.e., the 10 processes based on handle count).^[[193]citation needed]

   As with [194]Unix pipelines, PowerShell pipelines can construct complex
   commands, using the | operator to connect stages. However, the
   PowerShell pipeline differs from Unix pipelines in that stages execute
   within the PowerShell runtime rather than as a set of processes
   coordinated by the operating system, and structured .NET objects,
   rather than [195]byte streams, are passed from one stage to the next.
   Using [196]objects and executing stages within the PowerShell runtime
   eliminates the need to [197]serialize data structures, or to extract
   them by explicitly [198]parsing text output.^[199][28] An object can
   also encapsulate certain functions that work on the contained data,
   which become available to the recipient command for
   use.^[200][29]^[201][30] For the last cmdlet in a pipeline, PowerShell
   automatically pipes its output object to the Out-Default cmdlet, which
   transforms the objects into a stream of format objects and then renders
   those to the screen.^[202][31]^[203][32]

   Because all PowerShell objects are .NET objects, they share a
   .ToString() method, which retrieves the text representation of the data
   in an object. In addition, PowerShell allows formatting definitions to
   be specified, so the text representation of objects can be customized
   by choosing which data elements to display, and in what manner.
   However, in order to maintain backwards compatibility, if an external
   executable is used in a pipeline, it receives a text stream
   representing the object, instead of directly integrating with the
   PowerShell type system.^[204][33]^[205][34]^[206][35]

Scripting[[207]edit]

   Windows PowerShell includes a [208]dynamically typed [209]scripting
   language which can implement complex operations using cmdlets
   [210]imperatively. The scripting language supports variables,
   functions, branching ([211]if-then-else), loops ([212]while, [213]do,
   [214]for, and [215]foreach), structured error/exception handling and
   [216]closures/[217]lambda expressions,^[218][36] as well as integration
   with .NET. Variables in PowerShell scripts are prefixed with $.
   Variables can be assigned any value, including the output of cmdlets.
   Strings can be enclosed either in single quotes or in double quotes:
   when using double quotes, variables will be expanded even if they are
   inside the quotation marks. Enclosing the path to a file in braces
   preceded by a dollar sign (as in ${C:\foo.txt}) creates a reference to
   the contents of the file. If it is used as an [219]L-value, anything
   assigned to it will be written to the file. When used as an
   [220]R-value, the contents of the file will be read. If an object is
   assigned, it is serialized before being stored.^[[221]citation needed]

   Object members can be accessed using . notation, as in C# syntax.
   PowerShell provides special variables, such as $args, which is an array
   of all the command line arguments passed to a function from the command
   line, and $_, which refers to the current object in the
   pipeline.^[222][37] PowerShell also provides [223]arrays and
   [224]associative arrays. The PowerShell scripting language also
   evaluates arithmetic expressions entered on the command line
   immediately, and it parses common abbreviations, such as GB, MB, and
   KB.^[225][38]^[226][39]

   Using the function keyword, PowerShell provides for the creation of
   functions, the following general form:^[227][40]
function name ($Param1, $Param2)
{
  Instructions
}

   The defined function is invoked in either of the following
   forms:^[228][40]
name value1 value2
name -Param1 value1 -Param2 value2

   PowerShell supports named parameters, positional parameters, switch
   parameters and dynamic parameters.^[229][40]

   PowerShell allows any .NET methods to be called by providing their
   namespaces enclosed in brackets ([]), and then using a pair of colons
   (::) to indicate the static method.^[230][41] For example,
   [System.Console]::WriteLine("PowerShell"). Objects are created using
   the New-Object cmdlet. Calling methods of .NET objects is accomplished
   by using the regular . notation.^[231][41]

   PowerShell scripting language accepts [232]strings, both raw and
   [233]escaped. A string enclosed between single [234]quotation marks is
   a raw string while a string enclosed between double quotation marks is
   an escaped string. PowerShell treats straight and curly quotes as
   equivalent.^[235][42]

   For error handling, PowerShell provides a .NET-based
   [236]exception-handling mechanism. In case of errors, objects
   containing information about the error (Exception object) are thrown,
   which are caught using the try ... catch construct (although a trap
   construct is supported as well). However, the action-or-error is
   configurable; in case of an error, PowerShell can be configured to
   silently resume execution, without actually throwing the
   exception.^[237][43]

   Scripts written using PowerShell can be made to persist across sessions
   in either a .ps1 file or a .psm1 file (the latter is used to implement
   a module). Later, either the entire script or individual functions in
   the script can be used. Scripts and functions operate analogously with
   cmdlets, in that they can be used as commands in pipelines, and
   parameters can be bound to them. Pipeline objects can be passed between
   functions, scripts, and cmdlets seamlessly. To prevent unintentional
   running of scripts, script execution is disabled by default and must be
   enabled explicitly.^[238][44] Enabling of scripts can be performed
   either at system, user or session level. PowerShell scripts can be
   [239]signed to verify their integrity, and are subject to [240]Code
   Access Security.^[241][45]

   The PowerShell scripting language supports [242]binary prefix notation
   similar to the [243]scientific notation supported by many programming
   languages in the C-family.^[244][46]^[[245]better source needed]

Hosting[[246]edit]

   One can also use PowerShell embedded in a management application, which
   uses the PowerShell runtime to implement the management functionality.
   For this, PowerShell provides a [247]managed hosting [248]API. Via the
   APIs, the application can instantiate a runspace (one instantiation of
   the PowerShell runtime), which runs in the application's [249]process
   and is exposed as a Runspace object.^[250][4] The state of the runspace
   is encased in a SessionState object. When the runspace is created, the
   Windows PowerShell runtime initializes the instantiation, including
   initializing the providers and enumerating the cmdlets, and updates the
   SessionState object accordingly. The Runspace then must be opened for
   either synchronous processing or asynchronous processing. After that it
   can be used to execute commands.^[[251]citation needed]

   To execute a command, a pipeline (represented by a Pipeline object)
   must be created and associated with the runspace. The pipeline object
   is then populated with the cmdlets that make up the pipeline. For
   sequential operations (as in a PowerShell script), a Pipeline object is
   created for each statement and nested inside another Pipeline
   object.^[252][4] When a pipeline is created, Windows PowerShell invokes
   the pipeline processor, which resolves the cmdlets into their
   respective [253]assemblies (the command processor) and adds a reference
   to them to the pipeline, and associates them with InputPipe, Outputpipe
   and ErrorOutputPipe objects, to represent the connection with the
   pipeline. The types are verified and parameters bound using
   [254]reflection.^[255][4] Once the pipeline is set up, the host calls
   the Invoke() method to run the commands, or its asynchronous equivalent
   - InvokeAsync(). If the pipeline has the Write-Host cmdlet at the end
   of the pipeline, it writes the result onto the console screen. If not,
   the results are handed over to the host, which might either apply
   further processing or display the output itself.^[[256]citation needed]

   [257]Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 uses the hosting APIs to provide
   its management GUI. Each operation exposed in the GUI is mapped to a
   sequence of PowerShell commands (or pipelines). The host creates the
   pipeline and executes them. In fact, the interactive PowerShell console
   itself is a PowerShell host, which [258]interprets the scripts entered
   at command line and creates the necessary Pipeline objects and invokes
   them.^[[259]citation needed]

Desired State Configuration[[260]edit]

   DSC allows for declaratively specifying how a software environment
   should be configured.^[261][47]

   Upon running a configuration, DSC will ensure that the system gets the
   state described in the configuration. DSC configurations are
   idempotent. The Local Configuration Manager (LCM) periodically polls
   the system using the control flow described by resources (imperative
   pieces of DSC) to make sure that the state of a configuration is
   maintained.

Versions[[262]edit]

   Initially using the code name "Monad", PowerShell was first shown
   publicly at the Professional Developers Conference in September 2003.
   All major releases are still supported, and each major release has
   featured backwards compatibility with preceding versions.

PowerShell 1.0[[263]edit]

   PowerShell 1.0 was released in November 2006 for [264]Windows XP SP2,
   [265]Windows Server 2003 and [266]Windows Vista. It is an optional
   component of [267]Windows Server 2008.^[268][48]

PowerShell 2.0[[269]edit]

   Windows PowerShell ISE v2.0, an [270]integrated development environment
   for PowerShell scripts

   PowerShell 2.0 is integrated with [271]Windows 7 and [272]Windows
   Server 2008 R2^[273][49] and is released for [274]Windows XP with
   Service Pack 3, [275]Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 2, and
   [276]Windows Vista with Service Pack 1.^[277][50]^[278][51]

   PowerShell V2 includes changes to the scripting language and hosting
   API, in addition to including more than 240 new
   cmdlets.^[279][52]^[280][53]

   New features of PowerShell 2.0 include:^[281][54]^[282][55]^[283][56]
     * PowerShell Remoting: Using [284]WS-Management, PowerShell 2.0
       allows scripts and cmdlets to be invoked on a remote machine or a
       large set of remote machines.
     * Background Jobs: Also called a PSJob, it allows a command sequence
       (script) or pipeline to be invoked asynchronously. Jobs can be run
       on the local machine or on multiple remote machines. An interactive
       cmdlet in a PSJob blocks the execution of the job until user input
       is provided.
     * Transactions: Enable cmdlet and developers can perform
       [285]transactional operations. PowerShell 2.0 includes transaction
       cmdlets for starting, committing, and rolling back a PSTransaction
       as well as features to manage and direct the transaction to the
       participating cmdlet and provider operations. The PowerShell
       Registry provider supports transactions.
     * ScriptCmdlets: These are cmdlets written using the PowerShell
       scripting language. The preferred^[[286]by whom?] name for script
       cmdlets is now^[[287]when?] Advanced Functions.^[[288]citation
       needed]
     * SteppablePipelines: This allows the user to control when the
       BeginProcessing(), ProcessRecord() and EndProcessing() functions of
       a cmdlet are called.
     * Modules: This allows script developers and administrators to
       organize and partition PowerShell scripts in self-contained,
       reusable units. Code from a [289]module executes in its own
       self-contained context and does not affect the state outside the
       module. Modules can define a restricted runspace environment by
       using a script. They have a persistent state as well as public and
       private members.
     * Data Language: A domain-specific subset of the PowerShell scripting
       language that allows data definitions to be decoupled from the
       scripts and allows [290]localized string resources to be imported
       into the script at runtime (Script Internationalization).
     * Script Debugging: It allows [291]breakpoints to be set in a
       PowerShell script or function. Breakpoints can be set on lines,
       line & columns, commands and read or write access of variables. It
       includes a set of cmdlets to control the breakpoints via script.
     * Eventing: This feature allows listening, forwarding, and acting on
       management and system events. Eventing allows PowerShell hosts to
       be notified about state changes to their managed entities. It also
       enables PowerShell scripts to subscribe to ObjectEvents, PSEvents,
       and WmiEvents and process them synchronously and asynchronously.
     * Windows PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE):
       PowerShell 2.0 includes a GUI-based PowerShell host that provides
       integrated debugger, [292]syntax highlighting, tab completion and
       up to 8 PowerShell Unicode-enabled consoles (Runspaces) in a tabbed
       UI, as well as the ability to run only the selected parts in a
       script.
     * Network File Transfer: Native support for prioritized, throttled,
       and asynchronous transfer of files between machines using the
       [293]Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS).^[294][57]
     * New Cmdlets: Including Out-GridView, which displays tabular data in
       the [295]WPF [296]GridView object.
     * New Operators: -Split, -Join, and Splatting (@) operators.
     * Exception Handling with Try-Catch-Finally: Unlike other .NET
       languages, this allows multiple exception types for a single catch
       block.
     * Nestable Here-Strings: PowerShell [297]Here-Strings have been
       improved and can now nest.^[298][58]
     * Block Comments: PowerShell 2.0 supports block comments using <# and
       #> as delimiters.^[299][59]
     * New APIs: The new APIs range from handing more control over the
       PowerShell parser and runtime to the host, to creating and managing
       collection of Runspaces (RunspacePools) as well as the ability to
       create Restricted Runspaces which only allow a configured subset of
       PowerShell to be invoked. The new APIs also support participation
       in a Windows PowerShell managed transaction.

PowerShell 3.0[[300]edit]

   PowerShell 3.0 is integrated with [301]Windows 8 and with [302]Windows
   Server 2012. Microsoft has also made PowerShell 3.0 available for
   [303]Windows 7 with Service Pack 1, for [304]Windows Server 2008 with
   Service Pack 1, and for [305]Windows Server 2008 R2 with Service Pack
   1.^[306][60]^[307][61]

   PowerShell 3.0 is part of a larger package, Windows Management
   Framework 3.0 (WMF3), which also contains the WinRM service to support
   remoting.^[308][61] Microsoft made several [309]Community Technology
   Preview releases of WMF3. An early community technology preview 2 (CTP
   2) version of Windows Management Framework 3.0 was released on 2
   December 2011.^[310][62] Since then, updated versions have been shipped
   in the Windows 8 and Server 2012 [311]beta and [312]release candidate
   versions.^[[313]citation needed]

   New features in PowerShell 3.0 include:^[314][61]^[315][63]^:33-34
     * Scheduled jobs: Jobs can be scheduled to run on a preset time and
       date.
     * Session connectivity: Sessions can be disconnected and reconnected.
       Remote sessions have become more tolerant of temporary network
       failures.
     * Improved code writing: [316]Code completion (IntelliSense) and
       [317]snippets are added. PowerShell ISE allows users to use dialog
       boxes to fill in parameters for PowerShell cmdlets.
     * Delegation support: Administrative tasks can be delegated to users
       who do not have permissions for that type of task, without granting
       them perpetual additional permissions.
     * Help update: Help documentations can be updated via Update-Help
       command.
     * Automatic module detection: Modules are loaded implicitly whenever
       a command from that module is invoked. Code completion works for
       unloaded modules as well.
     * New commands: Dozens of new modules were added, including
       functionality to manage disks, volumes, firewalls, network
       connections and printer management, previously performed via
       WMI.^[[318]further explanation needed]

PowerShell 4.0[[319]edit]

   PowerShell 4.0 is integrated with [320]Windows 8.1 and with
   [321]Windows Server 2012 R2. Microsoft has also made PowerShell 4.0
   available for [322]Windows 7 SP1, [323]Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and
   [324]Windows Server 2012.^[325][64]

   New features in PowerShell 4.0 include:
     * Desired State Configuration^[326][65]^[327][66]^[328][67]:
       Declarative language extensions and tools that enable the
       deployment and management of configuration data for systems using
       the [329]DMTF management standards and [330]WS-Management Protocol.
     * New Default Execution Policy: On Windows Servers, the default
       execution Policy is now RemoteSigned
     * Save-Help: Help can now be saved for modules that are installed on
       remote computers.
     * Enhanced debugging: The debugger now supports debugging workflows,
       remote script execution and preserving debugging sessions across
       PowerShell session reconnections.
     * -PipelineVariable switch: A new ubiquitous parameter to expose the
       current pipeline object as a variable for programming purposes.
     * Network diagnostics to manage physical and Hyper-V's virtualized
       [331]network switches.
     * Where and ForEach method syntax provides an alternate method of
       filtering and iterating over objects.

PowerShell 5.0[[332]edit]

   Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 RTM which includes PowerShell
   5.0 was re-released to web on February 24, 2016, following an initial
   release with a severe bug.^[333][68] Key features include OneGet
   PowerShell cmdlets to support [334]Chocolatey's repository-based
   [335]package management^[336][69] and extending support for switch
   management to [337]layer 2 network switches.^[338][70]

   New features in PowerShell 5.0 include:
     * PowerShell class definitions (properties, methods)
     * PowerShell .NET Enumerations
     * Debugging for PowerShell Runspaces in remote processes
     * Debugging for PowerShell Background Jobs
     * Desired State Configuration (DSC) Local Configuration Manager (LCM)
       version 2.0
     * DSC partial configurations
     * DSC Local Configuration Manager meta-configurations
     * Authoring of DSC resources using PowerShell classes

   PowerShell 5.1 was released on August 2, 2016, in the [339]Windows 10
   Anniversary Update.^[340][71] PackageManagement now supports proxies,
   PSReadLine now has ViMode support, and two new cmdlets were added:
   Get-TimeZone and Set-TimeZone. The LocalAccounts module allows for
   adding/removing local user accounts.^[341][72]

Comparison of cmdlets with similar commands[[342]edit]

   The following table contains a selection of the cmdlets that ship with
   PowerShell, noting similar commands in other well-known command-line
   interpreters. Many of these similar commands come out-of-the-box
   defined as aliases within PowerShell, making it easy for people
   familiar with other common shells to start working.

Alternative implementation[[458]edit]

   A project named Pash (the name is a pun on the well-known "[459]bash"
   Unix shell^[460][97]) has been an [461]open source and
   [462]cross-platform re-implementation of PowerShell via the [463]Mono
   framework. Pash was created by Igor Moochnick, written in [464]C# and
   was released under the [465]GNU General Public License. Pash
   development stalled in 2008, but was restarted in
   2012.^[466][97]^[467][98]
